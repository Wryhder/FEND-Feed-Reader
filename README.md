# Project Overview

Feed Reader Testing is the fourth project required to graduate Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.
Objective of the project is to learn how to use [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) to write tests against a pre-existing application (a web-based application that reads RSS feeds).
The tests are written using [v2.2](https://jasmine.github.io/2.2/introduction); the library is [already included](https://github.com/Wryhder/FEND-Feed-Reader-Testing/tree/master/jasmine/lib/jasmine-2.1.2) in the files, so you do not need to worry about getting it.

The Feed Reader app is hosted [here](https://wryhder.github.io/FEND-Feed-Reader-Testing/).
Results of all tests run are displayed at the end of the page.
