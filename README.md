# Project Overview

Feed Reader Testing is the fourth project required to graduate Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.
Objective of the project is to learn how to use Jasmine to write tests against a pre-existing application (a web-based application that reads RSS feeds).

Results of all tests run are displayed at the end of the page.
